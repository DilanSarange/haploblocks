# Filters here are mostly generic, except ExcessHet, which you may
# want to adjust.
#
# Notes:
#   - Only variants satisfying ALL lines are kept. They are
#     conjunctions.
#
#   - For columns that may or may not have a value in the VCF,
#     you should check for NaN with isnan().
#
#   - MEAN_DP and SD_DP are not in the VCF, but are available
#     as global variables. They are computed over all inputs
#     before this filter is applied.
