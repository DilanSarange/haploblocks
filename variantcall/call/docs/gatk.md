GATK
=====

Packaged by the broad institute. Docker image: [on docker
hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/broadinstitute/gatk/)


This container is used to run the gatk portions of the pipeline, and our
reduce tool.

If the pipeline was to support freebayes or platypus, or GATK3, the
other custom container running the other set of the tools would work
best.
